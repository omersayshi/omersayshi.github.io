I did not know what it meant and I bet a lot of people do not know either. So, after extensive research, I decided to educate my readers on the term \u0026ldquo;Zoomer\u0026rdquo;.\nZoomer It is a term use to mock members of Generation Z (people born mid-1990s to early-2000s) and is a play off the word \u0026ldquo;Boomer.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s generally in reference to the very quick upbringing due to the rapid technological advancements and cultural change that happened because of social media, during their upbringing.\nif u ever see a kid making this dance move, he\u0026rsquo;s a zoomer.
